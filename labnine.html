            Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.
             In simple terms, it is about understanding how electricity works in order to use the knowledge for engineering applications.
             Electrical engineers defined the 20th century with technologies that transformed society.

            A chemical is any substance with a defined composition. Chemicals can be naturally occurring in nature or manufactured.
             Chemicals can also produce odors, but smelling an odor does not indicate how much exposure you have.
             Some chemicals are toxic and can cause health effects under certain conditions.</td>
